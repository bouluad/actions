To use this composite action in a workflow, you would pass in the required inputs, like this:

```
jobs:
  example-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Get Secret
        uses: your-username/get-secret-from-vault-with-approle@main
        with:
          vault-address: 'https://my-vault-server.com'
          vault-role-id: ${{ secrets.VAULT_ROLE_ID }}
          vault-secret-id: ${{ secrets.VAULT_SECRET_ID }}
          secret-path: 'secret/example'
          secret-key: 'my-secret-key'
      - name: Use Secret
        run: |
          echo "The secret value is $SECRET_VALUE"

```

Note that in the Get Secret step, we're passing in the vault-role-id and vault-secret-id inputs as secrets from the GitHub repository's secrets store. This is a best practice to avoid leaking sensitive information in the workflow logs.
