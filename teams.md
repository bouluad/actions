This composite GitHub Action performs the following steps:

1- Sends a message to a Microsoft Teams channel by sending an HTTP POST request to the webhook URL.
2- Uses the webhook URL for the Microsoft Teams channel, the message to be sent to the channel, and the status of the GitHub Action as inputs to the action.
To use this composite action in a workflow, you would define the inputs for the action and pass them as parameters to the uses key:

```
jobs:
  send-message-to-teams:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Send Message to Teams
        uses: your-username/microsoft-teams-integration@main
        with:
          webhook-url: ${{ secrets.MICROSOFT_TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL }}
          message: 'A new version of the app has been deployed.'
          status: 'success'
```

In this example, we're using the secrets.MICROSOFT_TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL secret for the webhook URL of the Microsoft Teams channel. We're also specifying the message to be sent to the channel and the status of the GitHub Action (which is optional).
